#Introduction to programs and programming language
- the term platform refers ta compatible set of hardware and software
that provides environment for software to run
- the act of modifying a program that runs on a different platform is called 
porting 


#Maching language
- the set of all possible machine language instruction that a given CPU can understand is called instruction set 

#Low level language cons 
- low level language are not portable
- writing low level language is hardware

#Introduction to high level language
- a compilter is a program that reads source code of one and trnaslate it to
another language
- an interprater is a program that directly executes the instruction in ths source code withot
requiring to be compiled. interpretter is called once program is called 
and should be installed where the program runs 

- distributing a compiled program is safe since they do not require the source code 

#Benefits of high level language 
- a program designed to run on multiple platforms is said to be cross platform 
- high level language are easier

###Introduction to C/C++

#What is C++ good at
- video games
- real time system 
- high frequency trading 
- office apps 
- embedded software 
- video audio processing 
- Ai and nueral networks


###Introduction to C/C++

#Define the problem that you would like to solve
- this "what" steps. where you figure out what problem you are intending to solve

#Determine how you are going to solve problem 
- good solution have the following charactheristic
    - straight forward and not complicated
    - well documented ( especially around any assumption being made or limitation)
    - built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without limiting
    - they can recover gracefully or give usefull error message when something unexepected happens


- if you dont plan it and start coding right away, you will have bug

################## Introduction to the compiler, linker, and libraries

#Define the problem to solve -> Design a solution ->
Write a program that implements the solution -> compile the program

### Compiling your source code

- In order to compile c++ source code files, we use a C++ compiler.
- it does two task

#Two task 
- first the compiler checks your C++ code to make sure it follows the rules of C++
If not, the compiler will give you an error ( and the corresponding line number )
to help pinpoint what needs fixing. the compilation process will aso be aborted until the error is fixed

- translate your C++ code into machine language instruction. These instruction are stored in object file

#Introduction to programs and programming language
- the term platform refers ta compatible set of hardware and software
that provides environment for software to run
- the act of modifying a program that runs on a different platform is called 
porting 


#Maching language
- the set of all possible machine language instruction that a given CPU can understand is called instruction set 

#Low level language cons 
- low level language are not portable
- writing low level language is hardware

#Introduction to high level language
- a compilter is a program that reads source code of one and trnaslate it to
another language
- an interprater is a program that directly executes the instruction in ths source code withot
requiring to be compiled. interpretter is called once program is called 
and should be installed where the program runs 

- distributing a compiled program is safe since they do not require the source code 

#Benefits of high level language 
- a program designed to run on multiple platforms is said to be cross platform 
- high level language are easier

#What is C++ good at
- video games
- real time system 
- high frequency trading 
- office apps 
- embedded software 
- video audio processing 
- Ai and nueral networks

#Introduction to programs and programming language
- the term platform refers ta compatible set of hardware and software
that provides environment for software to run
- the act of modifying a program that runs on a different platform is called 
porting 


#Maching language
- the set of all possible machine language instruction that a given CPU can understand is called instruction set 

#Low level language cons 
- low level language are not portable
- writing low level language is hardware

#Introduction to high level language
- a compilter is a program that reads source code of one and trnaslate it to
another language
- an interprater is a program that directly executes the instruction in ths source code withot
requiring to be compiled. interpretter is called once program is called 
and should be installed where the program runs 

- distributing a compiled program is safe since they do not require the source code 

#Benefits of high level language 
- a program designed to run on multiple platforms is said to be cross platform 
- high level language are easier


################################# 0.3 — Introduction to C/C+

### Before there was C

- c language was developed in 1972 by dennis ritchi at bell labs,
- there was a book name "The C Programming Language". this book which
was commonly known as K&R, has become the defactor when maximun portability
was needed (brian kernighan, and dennis ritchie )
- there was ANSI C, and c99, c90

### C++

- in 1978 c++ was born. bjarne stroutstrup at bell labs. 1979 
c++ adds many new fetures to the c language. best taught as a super set 
- best was it support OOP
- (C++20’s formal name is ISO/IEC 14882:2020),
- c++20 is the version published in 2020

### C++ and C philosophy

- c++ is designed to allow the programmer a high degree of freedom to do what they want.
this also wont stop you doing thing that dont make sense
- knowing what you should do in c++ is almost important as what you must do

### What is C++ good at

- video games
- real time system 
- high frequency trading 
- office apps 
- embedded software 
- video audio processing 
- Ai and nueral networks


### Isnt C++ dying 
- 2nd most popular compiled language behind java and c#
- 6th over all
- 

### Do I need to know C before I do these tutorials?
- once you know c++, it should pretty easy to learn standard C

######## Introduction to C++ development

### Steps
- define the problem to solve
- design a solution
- write a program that implements the solution
- compile
- link object files 
- test program
- debug ( repeat in compile )

### Design a solution
- wrong approach is if you get the idea, sit down, and immediatley 
start coding a solution.

# Good solutions have this charactheristics
- they are straightforward not confusing and complex 
- they are well documented especially around assumption being made or limitations
- they are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later 
without impacting other parts of the program 
- they recover gracefull or give usefull error message when something happens 

- 10-40 percent is writing program, 60 to 90 is debugging 
- so better think carefully before writing

#### Write the program
- you need knowledge of a programming language, we need a text editor
- may c++ program have only one source code file. but complex C++ programs have hundred 
or even thousand of code source
- BP - write the primary source code file in each program main cpp
which source code file is the primary one



################################# 0.4 — Introduction to C/C+

- before we can write and execute our first C++ program
we need to understand in more detail how C++, get developed

define the problem -> design solution -> write -> compile
-> link object files -> test program -> debug ( return to compile again 
repeat step )

- comming up with the initial idea for what you would like to program can be easiest
step, or the hardest but conceptually, it is simplest
